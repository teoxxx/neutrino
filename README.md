High energy neutrino emission from astrophysical jets. Written by Theodoros Smponias in 2014-15. Ref. https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03087.

NEW! Now includes nemiss_pload4d, a new and updated version of the program, one that works in 4D: Accompanies rlos2 and also works as a standalone program. Data-centric approach, tested and verifed with one-another and independently. May calculate nemiss globally and then do relativistic imaging from that in rlos2. nemiss_pload4d is a highly improved version of the software, going from calcing point source emission to global, 4D special relat. calcs.

2 DO: 
i. Parallelize (SetSharedVar? From beginning onwards, step by step through ze calc), 
ii. Put the units in (application dependent).
